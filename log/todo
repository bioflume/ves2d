DONE
* Extensional flow:  rerun two vesicle experiments
  . No upsampling for standard code;
  . First order in time: N=32, N=64, Time Horizon Large, different dt's  with
		and without nearly singular
  . Explicit and Implicit.

DONE   
* Explit + near sinuglar, Taylor green ,implicit-explicit treatment
  Time horizon: 200
  volume fraction: (for stability tests) 9 vesicles A=1/3.2 

DONE
 just one run: explicit, first  Increase volume fraction to 45\% 
    dt =1e-4, 
 
GOING TO TRY SPECTRAL DEFERRED CORRECTION
* Adaptive time stepping
  - first order; either adapt so that you avoid collisions, or just
	using standard truncation error (or both). Bryan to prepare
	write-up for different options
  Some references on newer work:
  http://www.amath.unc.edu/Faculty/minion/pubs/PDF/mesdc.pdf
  - detecting possibility for collision requires Walid's scheme
	needs to be incorporated in the main code.


* Walid: 
  . Tracer velocity becomes discontinuous
  . Latex: write-up for nearly singular integration
  . Matlab:
    - Documentation of nearly singular integrals
       (input, output, function description)
    - FMM for nearly singular, you need it for particle evaluation
    - Arbitrary target points (for tracers)
    - Tracer tracking using time steps. (no need to couple with the
  solver, this should be 

* George: projecting shape to specified area length

* Computing stresses

DONE
* Integrate viscosity and boundaries for couette flow.

* Adhesion/repulsion, near-range forces?

DONE
* Preconditioners for single and coupled vesicles? (implicit
  time-stepping 20 times more expensive)

DONE
Figure out second-order implicit scheme, why do we get first order 
convergence?  First single vesicle, then extensional flow.

DONE
Finish tables with extensional flow (after resolving the second-order 
scheme)

DONE
For vortex flow, compare explicit first-order with implicit second-order

DONE
Automate volume fraction: Input: vesicle length, reduced area, volume 
fraction.
