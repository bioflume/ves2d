\subsection{Governing equations}
We are solving
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\xx_{j}}{dt} &= \SS_{jj} \ff_{j} + 
    \DD_{jj} \frac{d\xx_{j}}{dt} +
    \sum_{k \neq j} \left(\SS_{jk} \ff_{k} +
    \DD_{jk} \frac{d\xx_{k}}{dt} \right) + 
    \DD_{j\Gamma} \eeta \\
  \ff_{k} &= -\kappa \frac{d^{4}\xx_{k}}{ds^{4}} + 
    \frac{d}{ds}\left(\sigma_{k} \frac{d\xx_{k}}{ds}\right) \\
  0 &= \frac{d\xx_{j}}{ds} \cdot \frac{d}{ds}\frac{d\xx_{j}}{dt} \\
  \UU &= - \frac{1}{2}\eeta + \DD_{\Gamma\Gamma} \eeta +
    \sum_{k} \left(\SS_{\Gamma k} \ff_{k} +
    \DD_{\Gamma k} \frac{d\xx_{k}}{dt} \right) 
\end{align}

\subsection{Discretization in space}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fourier representation
  \item Derivatives computed with FFT
  \item Single-layer potential with Alpert
  \item Double-layer potential with trapezoid rule
  \item Near-singular integration for nearly touching vesicles
  \item FMM to accelerate layer potential evaluations
  \item Low-order Alpert quadrature.  With the old one, if 16 or fewer
  points are used, the rule doesn't make sense
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discretization in time}
\begin{itemize}
  \item IMEX Euler
  \item Implicit vesicle-vesicle interactions
  \item SDC to increase accuracy
  \item Time adaptivity
\end{itemize}
