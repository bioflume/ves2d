Reviewer #1: The paper extends a current publication of the authors
(JCP 274 (2014) 245-267) by considering a different time
discretization. Efficient time discretizations are an important issue
for simulations of vesicle suspensions. However, there are certain
aspects, which should be addressed before publication:

- several parts of the introduction are more or less copied from the
earlier paper

- the paper is hard to read as a stand alone paper, as even the
system of equations to be solved is not written down

- it is nice to see a statement of limitations of the method,
however it is not understandable, why several limitations
mentioned in the earlier paper, should have gone away, e.g.
transient and inertia effects

- what is highlighted here as an innovative criteria for
adaptive time stepping, is just a phenomenological indicator,
it is certainly good to control area and interface length,
but it does not say anything about the quality of the
solution (a constant in time solution would do the job, but
would be wrong for most examples). Here I miss computational
results, demonstrating that the used error indicators are
indeed sufficient to control the error of the solution. At
least for the relaxation flow the stationary shape and the
evolution to it are known and can be used as a criteria.
Otherwise you could use criteria such as circularity or
center of mass position to validate your solution. Can you
show that the energy is decreasing for all the chosen time
steps?

- the comparison in 5.1 remains unclear, is the BDF the
second order scheme from your previous paper or is it a
different method, how does SDC compare with the results in
the previous paper? As already mentioned in the text an
improvement of SDC can not really be observed for the
second order scheme

- as almost the same examples are used as in the previous
paper, a follow up paper should at least used the same
complexity of the examples and demonstrate an improvement
in computing time, much better would be to show an
improvement in complexity of the problem solvable, in 5.4
the complexity is even reduced, which is not acceptable

- last, it is the second algorithmic paper of the authors
on the subject, any meaningful biophysical question,
which could be answered by the simulations, is not even
asked, and should be added and answered in a revised
version
