We discuss the behaviour of the different time integrators for several
bounded and unbounded vesicle suspensions.  Because of the
incompressibility of the fluid and the inextensibility of the vesicles,
the area enclosed by a vesicle and its total length remain fixed.
However, due to numerical errors, these quantities change throughout
simulations.  Penalty methods are often used to enforce maintain the
vesicles length, but these techniques change the physics of the problem.
In our formulation, no such penalty method is used and the
inextensibility constraint is enforced algebraically
using~\eqref{e:inextensibility}.  Even though the length and area of the
vesicles are low-order moments of the shape, we have experimentally
found that they are good estimates for the error of our numerical
methods.  Therefore, we use the relative errors in area and length to
study the convergence rates of our different time integrators.  We also
report minimum distances between vesicles and solid walls to demonstrate
convergence, but without an exact solution, we must used an over-refined
solution as the exact solution.  The experiments we perform are now
summarized.


\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Shear Flow} 
(Tables~\ref{t:shear:RA65}--\ref{t:shear:RA99} and
Figure~\ref{f:shear:reducedAreas}): Here we consider the classic
problem of two vesicles in the shear flow $\uu = (y,0)$ with the left
vesicle slightly elevated from the right vesicle.  We study the effect
of the reduced area and the viscosity contrast on the dynamics.  Then,
we compare the three different stable time integrators we have
discussed: first-order with explicit and semi-implicit inter-vesicle
interactions and second-order with semi-implicit inter-vesicle
interactions.  All three methods converge at the expected rate.
Moreover, if we use first-order time stepping, semi-implicit and
explicit inter-vesicle interactions give similar errors.  Therefore,
for first-order time stepping, if the time step is small enough, using
explicit inter-vesicle interactions is appropriate since the
resulting linear system is easier to solve.

\item{\bf Taylor-Green Flow}
(Table~\ref{t:taylorGreen:convergence} and
Figures~\ref{f:taylorGreen:collision}--\ref{f:taylorGreen:summary}):
Here we look at the stability of the semi-implicit inter-vesicle
interactions.  For a short time horizon, we quantify its stability.  We
do a convergence study and also discuss a significant difference in the
behaviour of the first- and second-order time integrators.

\item {\bf Extensional Flow}
(Table~\ref{t:extensional:convergence} and
Figure~\ref{f:extensional:summary}): We consider two vesicles placed
symmetrically in an extensional flow.  We show that the simulation is
unstable without near-singular integration.  A convergence study shows
that we achieve the desired first- and second-order convergence.  We
also report CPU times to demonstrate that we are achieving the expected
complexity.

\item{\bf Stenosis} 
(Table~\ref{t:stenosis:errors}--\ref{t:stenosis:gapSize} and
Figure~\ref{f:stenosis:snaps}): We consider a single vesicle passing
through a constriction in a confined flow.  We are able to take a
vesicle that is over two times taller than a similar simulation
in~\cite{rah:vee:bir}.  A convergence study on the errors in area and
length as well as the minimium distance between the vesicle and solid
wall show that we achieve second-order accuracy.

\item{\bf Couette Apparatus}
(Figures~\ref{f:couetteLow}--\ref{f:couetteHigh}): High concentration
flows are demonstrated with two Couette simulations, one with a moderate
volume fraction and one with a high volume fraction.  We compare first-
and second-order time stepping with the moderate volume fraction and
observe a similar behaviour in the errors that is described in the
Taylor-Green example.  For the larger volume fraction, we report results
for first- and second-order time stepping which both require
semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions for the chosen time step size
to be stable.

\end{itemize}

Other details of our results include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The parameters we investigate are the number of points per
vesicle, $N$, the number of vesicles, $M$, the number of points per
solid wall, $N_{\mathrm{wall}}$, the time step size, $\Delta t$, the
viscosity contrast, $\nu$, and the time integrator.

\item An important dimensionless quantity is the vesicle's reduced
area: the ratio of its area to the area of a circle of the same
perimeter.  Because of the incompressibility and inextensibility
constraints, the reduced area should remain constant.  Intuitively, the
reduced area indicates how much the vesicle can deform.  The closer the
reduced area is to its maximum value of one, the less it is able to
deform.  We are particularly interested in vesicles of reduced area
0.65. This value results in shapes that resemble (two-dimensional
approximations of) red blood cells.

\item All vesicle-to-vesicle and vesicle-to-wall interactions are
accelerated with the FMM.  The wall-to-wall iterations are precomputed
and stored and the wall-to-vesicle interactions are computed with the
direct method which results in a $\bigO(MNN_{\mathrm{wall}})$
calculation.  For flows with viscosity contrast, the double-layer
potential is also evaluated with the direct method resulting in a
$\bigO(M^{2}N^{2})$ calculation.  Fast algorithms for these
interactions are under consideration.

\item We precondition all the linear systems with the block-diagonal
preconditioner.  We have observed that this results in a
mesh-independent solver with semi-implicit interactions.

\item We have experimented with different GMRES tolerances.  If it is
too large, second-order convergence is difficult to achieve.  If it is
to small, the condition number of the block-diagonal preconditioner
makes the tolerance unachievable.  Experimentally we have found that
$10^{-12}$ is a good compromise.

\item The bending modulus sets the time scale.  We let $\kappa_{b}=0.1$
for all simulations.

\item All simulations are preformed in MATLAB on a six-core 2.67GHz
Intel Xeon processor with 24GB of memory. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Estimation of the overall complexity}
Here we summarize the cost of the most expensive parts of the overall
algorithm.  Recall that we are using a mesh-independent preconditioned
GMRES iteration.  Therefore, the cost can be summarized by the time
required to preform one matrix-vector product.
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\em {Vesicle-vesicle interactions:}}
    Using the FMM, the single-layer potential requires $\bigO(MN)$
    operations. 

  \item{\em {Viscosity contrast:}}
    Since we do not have a fast algorithm to compute the double-layer
    potential, viscosity contrast requires $\bigO(M^{2}N^{2})$
    operations.  However, this is just a shortcoming of the specific
    implementation, not a theoretical one.

  \item{\em {Confined flows:}}
    Wall-to-wall interactions are precomputed and stored.
    Wall-to-vesicle interactions require $\bigO(MNN_{\mathrm{wall}})$
    operations and vesicle-to-wall interactions require
    $\bigO(MN+N_{\mathrm{wall}})$ operations using the FMM.

  \item{\em {Near-singular integration:}}
    Our near-singular integration complexity is summarized in
    Section~\ref{s:near-singular}.  The upsampling results in an
    increase in the above complexities.  For instance, vesicle-vesicle
    interactions with the FMM require $\bigO(MN^{3/2}+MN)$ operations
    and vesicle-to-wall interactions require
    $\bigO(MN^{3/2}+N_{wall})$.  However, since we have not implemented
    a fast summation for the double-layer potential, flows with a
    viscosity contrast require a $\bigO(M^{2}N^{5/2})$ calculation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shear Flow}
Here we consider two vesicles in the shear flow $(y,0)$.  We initially
place the left vesicle's center slightly above the x-axis and place the
right vesicle's center exactly on the x-axis.  Initially, we expect the
right vesicle to undergo tank-treading~\cite{kantsler,misbah2006} while
the other vesicle will travel from left to right.  Here we study the
effect of the reduced area and the viscosity contrast on the dynamics
and errors.  We expect vesicles with larger viscosity contrast and
larger reduced areas to behave more like rigid bodies.  In particular,
we expect them to come closer to one another.
Figure~\ref{f:shear:reducedAreas} indicate that a higher viscosity
contrast results in the vesicles coming closer together.  Moreover, for
larger reduced areas, the effect of the viscosity contrast is less
pronounced.  We also see that vesicles with a larger reduced area come
closer together.

We now do a convergence study for both values of the reduced area and
viscosity contrast.  We vary the number of points per vesicle, the
number of time steps, and the time integrator.  We report the errors in
area and length at the time horizon $t=12$ in Tables~\ref{t:shear:RA65}
and~\ref{t:shear:RA99}.  First, we see that first- and second-order
convergence is achieved for all combinations of reduced area and
viscosity contrast.  Second, semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions
do not improve the accuracy of first-order time stepping, but, we will
see later that this time integrator is more stable.

\subsection{Taylor-Green Flow}
\label{s:taylorGreen}
We consider the Taylor-Green flow $\uu = (\sin x \cos y,-\cos x \sin
y)$ with 9 vesicles each with $N=64$ points of reduced area 0.65 placed
inside the periodic cell $(0,2\pi)^{2}$ (left plot of
Figure~\ref{f:taylorGreen:collision}).  We consider first-order IMEX
Euler with both semi-implicit and explicit inter-vesicle interactions.
We find the largest time step of both methods so that the vesicles do
not cross before a time horizon of $T = 1$.  With explicit
interactions, the vesicles cross if $74$ time steps are taken but not
if $75$ time steps are taken.  However, with semi-implicit
interactions, the simulation successfully completes even with one time
step.  Of course the error is too large and a time step size this large
is unreasonable.

\begin{figure}[htp]

cross after only 13 time steps.  However, with semi-implicit
interactions (right plot), the vesicles do not cross.  The bottom plots
show magnifications of the region where the explicit solver first
crosses.}{f:taylorGreen:collision}
\end{figure}

For this example, we found that using explicit interactions with 75
time steps requires approximately the same amount of CPU time as using
semi-implicit interactions with 30 time steps.  Therefore, if one
permits the error to be approximately 2.5 times larger, using
semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions is justified.

We do a convergence study for first- and second-order time stepping
with semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions.  If these interactions
are treated explicitly, the coarsest simulation results in the vesicles
crossing.  We achieve the desired first-order convergence, but
second-order convergence is not achieved at these resolutions.
However, we ran the simulation with $\Delta t = 3.13e-4$ and $\Delta t
= 1.56e-4$ and this is where second-order convergence is first
observed; the error in area reduced by $4.67$ and the error in length
reduced by $3.96$.

We have also observed a qualitative difference in the
behaviour of the errors of first- and second-order time stepping.  The
errors of the first-order methods continue to grow throughout the
simulation, while for second-order time stepping, the errors
plateau.  Thus, given a fixed time step size, second-order time stepping
can simulate longer time horizons than first-order time stepping.  We
demonstrate this behaviour in the bottom plot of
Figure~\ref{f:taylorGreen:summary} where we plot the errors in area and
length for the first- and second-order time stepping.  Snapshots of the
simulation are in the top plots of Figure~\ref{f:taylorGreen:summary}.

\subsection{Extensional Flow}
We consider two vesicles with reduced area $0.65$ symmetrically placed
around the origin (top plots of Figure~\ref{f:extensional:summary}).
The background velocity is given by $\uu = (-x,y)$.  We first run the
simulation with and without near-singular integration.  We compute the
distance between the vesicles, and the errors in area and length
(bottom plots of Figure~\ref{f:extensional:summary}).  We see that when
$t \approx 5$, the simulation without near-singular integration begins
to introduce large errors in the area of the vesicles.  This indicates
that the approximation of the single-layer potential is not adequate.
Then, around $t \approx 12$, the vesicles are too close for the
$N$-point trapezoid rule and the simulations fails.  This agrees with
our error estimate from Appendix~\ref{A:AppendixA}  since for this
simulation, an arclength term is approximately 0.24.  However, with
near-singular integration, the simulation successfully runs to
completion.

We report the errors in area and length at $t=24$ in
Table~\ref{t:extensional:convergence}.  Also reported is the error in
the distance between the vesicles at $t=24$, for which we take the
``true'' distance from an overrefined simulation.  As before, we
achieve first-order convergence and there is little difference between
the accuracy when comparing explicit and semi-implicit inter-vesicle
interactions.  We also achieve second-order convergence, but it
requires a finer time step size when compared to the first-order
methods before the asymptotic rate is achieved.

In Table~\ref{t:extensional:convergence}, we also list the required CPU
time per time step relative to the smallest simulation.  When the
number of points is doubled from 32 to 64, the amount of work per time
step goes up by less than a factor of two.  The increase in CPU time
when $N$ is doubled from 64 to 128 is attributed to extra work required
by near-singular integration since, to simplify the implementation, we
only work with powers of 2.  Therefore, we upsample 64 to 256, but 128
is upsampled to 4096.  We also see that semi-implicit inter-vesicle
interactions are computationally not much more expensive.  This is
because a lot of work is spent precomputing the block-diagonal
preconditioner which is done once per time step for all the time
integrators.

\subsection{Stenosis}

We consider a single vesicle of reduced area $0.65$ in a constricted
tube.  The solid wall is parameterized as $\xx(\theta) =
10r(\theta)\cos(\theta)$ and $y(\theta) =
3r(\theta)\sin(\theta)\eta(\theta)$, where $r(\theta) =
(\cos(\theta)^{8} + \sin(\theta)^{8})^{-1/8}$, and
\begin{align*}
  \eta(\theta) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{cl}
      \frac{1-0.6\cos(x)}{1.6} & |x(\theta)| \leq \pi, \\
      1 & |x(\theta)| > \pi.
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{align*}
For this geometry, the error of the trapezoid rule is $\bigO(10^{-4})$
with $N_{\mathrm{wall}}=256$ points and is $\bigO(10^{-6})$ with
$N_{\mathrm{wall}}=512$ points.  We impose a Gaussian-shaped boundary
condition at the intake and outake of the tube which is plotted along
with the geometry in Figure~\ref{f:stenosis:snaps}.  The vesicle's
initial height is $2.3$ times larger than the size of the constriction.
We report a convergence study for second-order time stepping in
Table~\ref{t:stenosis:errors} and we exceed the expected rate of
convergence.  We note that for this example, $N_{\mathrm{wall}}$ can not
be less than 256.  If it is, the Lagrange interpolation points required
by near-singular integration for wall-to-vesicle interactions are on
both sides of the solid wall.  Since the double-layer potential has a
jump across the solid wall, this creates a discontinuity in the velocity
field and the method becomes unstable.

This example is ideally situated for adaptive time stepping.  As the
vesicle passes through the constriction, large jumps in the errors are
committed.  In the simulation with $\Delta t = 5.0e-3$, the error in
length jumps by four orders of magnitude, and the error in area jumps
by three orders of magnitude near $t=3$.  These jumps are less severe
in the simulation with $\Delta t = 2.5e-3$, which has a jump of one
order of magnitude in length and two orders of magnitude in area.

We also report the minimum distance, and the time when the minimum
distance occurs, between the vesicle and the solid wall in
Table~\ref{t:stenosis:gapSize}.  In order to focus the error on the time
step size, we take a fine spatial resolution of $N=256$ and
$N_{\mathrm{wall}}=512$.  We report the minimum over time of the
distance 
\begin{align*}
  d(\gamma,\Gamma) = \inf_{\xx \in \gamma, \yy \in \Gamma} \|\xx - \yy\|
\end{align*}
rather than the error since an exact solution is not available.  The
time integrators predict different locations, $t_{\min}$, where the
minimum occurs, but they both are converging.  For the first-order
results, if we compare the minimum distances with the distance of the
most accurate second-order simulation at $t=5.26$, which is $9.6369e-2$,
then we see that first-order convergence has been achieved.  Without a
much more accurate numerical solution, we are unable to compute
convergence rates for the second-order results.  However, it appears
that we have resolved the distance up to at least three digits of
accuracy.

\subsection{Couette Apparatus}
\label{s:couette}
Here we consider two simulations of a Couette apparatus with different
volume fractions.  We first consider a Couette apparatus where the
inner boundary, which is slightly off-centered, is rotating with
constant angular velocity and the outer boundary is fixed.  We randomly
place 42 vesicles of reduced area 0.65 inside the apparatus which
corresponds to a volume fraction of 20\%.  Each vesicle is discretized
with 64 points, each solid wall with 64 points, the time step size is
$0.01$, and the time horizon is $T=30$.  Snapshots of the simulation
are in the top plots of Figure~\ref{f:couetteLow}.  Using first-order
time stepping with explicit inter-vesicle interactions, the error in
area is $1.70e-2$ and the error in length is $7.94e-2$ at $t=30$.
Semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions are not required for this time
step size.  The simulation took a little less than 6 hours, or about
7.1 seconds per time step.

We repeat this experiment with second-order time stepping which
requires semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions.  The simulation took
about 83 hours, or about 100 seconds per time step.  The errors in area
and length at $t=30$ are $2.95e-3$ and $7.13e-4$.  To achieve a similar
accuracy with first-order time stepping, a time step size 11 times
smaller would be required which would require more than 83 hours of CPU
time due to the double-layer potentials.  Moreover, the errors in area
and length for second-order time stepping have plateaued while for
first-order time stepping, they continue to grow (bottom plots of
Figure~\ref{f:couetteLow}).  Again, this means that with second-order
time stepping, we can take much longer time horizons without requiring
a smaller time step size.

integrators.  Notice that the errors for first-order method  continue to
grow whereas the errors for the second-order method
plateau.}{f:couetteLow}
\end{figure}

We now consider a Couette apparatus with the inner boundary exactly in
the middle of the outer boundary.  We use 150 vesicles of reduced area
0.65 resulting in a volume fraction of approximately $40.5\%$.  With
this higher concentration, a finer discretization of the solid walls is
required to resolve its density function $\eeta$.  Therefore, we have
discretized both boundaries with 256 points.  We also used our
collision detection algorithm to alert us if vesicles had crossed.
With $\Delta t = 0.01$ and explicit inter-vesicle interactions, the
first-order method results in crossing vesicles.  Therefore, we report
the results using first-order semi-implicit inter-vesicle interactions
which does not result in vesicles crossing.  Snapshots are illustrated
in Figure~\ref{f:couetteHigh}.  On average, each time step required 27
GMRES iterations. The total simulation took about 10 days, but this
number will drop dramatically once the double-layer potential is
implemented with a fast summation method.  At $t=10$, the error in area
is $9.62e-3$ and the error in length is $1.92e-2$.  We also ran this
simulation with second-order time stepping and achieved an error in
area of $9.39e-4$ and an error in length of $4.19e-4$.
