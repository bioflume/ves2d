This is a very nice, very interesting paper which is clearly written.
It will make an excellent addition to the Proceedings. I recommend that
it be accepted with minor corrections. I ask the authors to please
attend to the following points:

- define the jump notation [[ ]] used in line 6 of section 2.

- state explicitly that gamma_j is the surface of the jth vesicle in
gamma, the union of all vesicles.

- define s_y in the integral in the first equation of p. 3.

- line 2 above equation (2): change sigma to sigma_k.

- insert `updated' before `provisional' in step 4 of the SDC
iteration in section 3.

- should it say `A first-order approximation of (2)' [i.e. not (3)]
in the first line of section 3.1?

- give a suitable book reference for the Runge phenomenon alluded
to on page 5.

- define `reduced area' (first line of section 4).

- In section 4.1 say how the N=96 points are distributed.

- p. 7, line 3> Suggest change `in excess of' to `better than'.

- Table 1, 2: Insert `m' after `number' in the table captions.
Give the time units for CPU time.
