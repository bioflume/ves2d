In this code, the comments are after the statement. 

Ves2D.m  - driver API to vesicle simulations
tstep.m
capsules.m - main class for capsule and solid wall  geometry
curve.m - geometry, arclength, area correction, and restric/prolong
poten.m - all potential and layer evaluations and near singular evaluation
monitor.m - plots/checkpointing/monitoring residuals
fft1.m - spectral differentiation/interpolation

TODO:
- clean up tstep.m
- make all examples run
- fmm accuracy option
- velocity postprocessing without solves
- redistributeArcLength(o,x,y) in curve.m
jacobian calculation when arclength is corrected, should be done
with upsampling and should be set to one and not recomputed during the
vesicle calculations; and precompute all the derivate operators and
keep them fixed throught out the simulation, especially for the
low-accuracy versions. (Speculative, may it will create problems)

COMPLETED:
- remove/clarify selfMatTrap in poten.m (nearSingInt)
      Removed on July 18

- position should be saved before area/length correction and arc length correction
      Completed on July 21.  Area and length and redistribution in
      arclength are done first, followed by a time step, and followed
      by writing the new position to the .bin files
